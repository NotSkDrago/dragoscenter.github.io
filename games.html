                <h3>Terrible Turtle</h3>
                <h4>My first game project which is still in the works. The lore isn't done nor is it even close to complete, but heres what it is now:</h4>
                <p>You play as a turtle who can fly and shoot with a mounted gun on his back.
                    His ocean was taken over by plastics that the people just dumped into the ocean.
                    After watching many of his kin die he decided to fight back.
                </p>
                <p>My plans on adding stuff for now are starting on the enemy movements, attack patterns, and overall playability.
                    I want to add more player movement and work on projectiles. Also, my friend needs to work on the art for the title and play and options art.
                    After all that I plan to work on the bosses movement which will be random so its different for every player.
                    The last thing I plan to do is implement a storyline, transitions, cutscenes, and a just overall visual stuff.
                </p>
