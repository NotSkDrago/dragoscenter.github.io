                <h2>Lets Begin:</h2>
                <h3>Future Prospects:</h3>
                <p class="abmetxt"> So to start off, my future prospects. I have many, I hope to grow in the world of programming and web design and become a larger individual.
                    I want to create many friends and gain connections to learn from or help. I also want to find a great job that pays well after I've already gotten setup.
                    This is mostly it for my future prospects this may be changed as I grow and become more experienced.
                </p>
                <h3>Plans:</h3>
                <p class="abmetxt">My plans are simple. Get a great job, find many freelancing opportunities, grow a family and be able to provide for them, and help people who may need help.
                    These plans are like my future prospects, still growing as I gain more experience.
                </p>
                <h3>General History:</h3>
                <h5>(this can be skipped)</h5>
                <p class="abmetxt">For some general history I was born in Florida on August 8th 2007. When I was younger my family moved a lot.
                    My dad has been blue collar his entire life and had to move around a lot when I was younger.
                    This caused a lot of problems as I could never settle and gain many friends or just have a genuine social life.
                    This changed when my mom and dad got a divorce in 2016. This hit me like a truck, but now that I am older I realize it was for the better.
                    The divorce opened up a lot more freedoms for me for reasons I will not go in to.
                    Yet even with this I was still young and was confused and in a lot of pain from my family being ripped apart.
                    I got into a bad situation all the way until junior year.
                    This was when I decided to go online yet still online school never made me feel like I was learning anything.
                    So I dropped out and got my GED(I will be getting my GED as of now when I first created this I didn't have it yet).
                    This opened even more opportunities for self teaching with code and web design and more.
                    When I made this decision it felt like weights were lifted off my shoulder and I grew very quickly.
                    I learned multiple programming languages because I had time to. As of now I know a bit of Python, but most profficient in CSS, HTML, and JS.
                    From now on I plan to grow and leave behind a pretty mediocre past.
                </p>
                <h3>Philosophies and Beliefs:</h3>
                <p class="abmetxt" id="bottomabme">I will keep this short to avoid being controversial. Overall, I live by the true nature of stoicism.
                    This is, not getting mad about things you cannot control, focusing on the things in life you can control, and working around problems without getting upset.</p>
